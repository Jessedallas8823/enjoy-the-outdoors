# enjoy-the-outdoors
Doing This project was very fun during the creation I got inspired by pairing the content with a brand I really love which was The North Face. It just seemed like perfect match of content to go with their apparel pairing specific apparel for the parks page with  a light weight selection and the mountains page  with a heaver coat meant to withstand the cold. This capstone turned into a passion project, some since after i began to understand using arrays more I am gaining confidence in my skills.
The hardest part of this was figuring out how to filter both dropdown searches to interact with each other, I didn't get to complete this task but will be going back to do so.This is a project I would love to show future employers to show case my creativity and ability to think outside the box when given simple tasks.
 
 one code that i enjoyed doing most is learning how to play videos on html at first i was only left with a still image for a video until i researched how to add controls to function the video 
  <video controls src="/images/info-01-summit-verbier-gtx-jacket-1080.mp4" alt="Description" width="800" height="500">

  </video>
another tough task that ended up having an easy fix was adding the gif logo into the nav bar first it would not render 

during this project I gained a great understanding in my css and I feel more confident in what I coded last project I didnt really understand css because it is alot of trial and error. 
 biggest challenge having to replace video files with place holders due to git bash storage restriction only allowing up to 100mb
